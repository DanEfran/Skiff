- Standards
	- Power input:
		- INPUT: 12VAC (AC: plug polarity irrelevant)
		- 2.1mm pin power jack:
			- Tayda SKU A-2237 "DC Power Jack 2.1mm Enclosed Frame With Switch"
		- current brick: Jameco ReliaPro 120VAC 60Hz 29 W -> 12VAC 2000mA
		- main power switch: 
			- Tayda SKU A-4727 "Yellow LED Dot Light Rocker Switch ON/OFF SPST 12V"
	- Module power connectors:
		- Tayda SKU A-5505 "3 Pins JST XH-2.54 Male connector Straight 180Â°"
		- Tayda SKU A-6682 "3 Pins JST XH-2.54 Female connector with Cable"
			- Black: GND. Red: +12v. Yellow: -12v.
		- Modules needing 5v, etc. must work it out for themselves.
	- Exterior dimensions
		- 12" wide 8.25" tall 55mm deep
		- Current version is foam core board; imperfect but approximately correct size
			to fit in vertical mounting space. Replace with a sturdier version any time.
	- Interior dimensions
		- about 4U x 56 HP x 45mm:
		- depth 45mm (back wall to back of faceplates, which sit about 5mm behind box edge)
			- depth of MIDI/MIXER is much less due to POWER behind them.
		- width 290-292mm (about ~11.5", slightly narrower at power supply end)
			- about 55-57 HP modular rack unit width, depending on tolerances
		- height 7" = 177-178mm
			- 4U modular rack unit height
			- plus 7/8" POWER/MIDI/MIXER strip, which is not counted in the rack size
				- which could be top or bottom! I've been thinking of it as the top,
					but it might be more ergonomic at the bottom, with the power cord
					and such hanging down below the box, when used vertically. If the
					skiff is used on a flat surface, it's probably more ergonomic at
					the top. It should be kept as reversible as possible.
		- faceplace sizes
			- Roughly based on existing 1U Tile standards:
			- Height per U is about 44mm, closest to Pulp Logic 1U height of 43.18mm
				- Intellijel 1U is 39.65mm high, which would leave gaps (for rail edges?)
			- Width of a 6HP tile: about 30mm
				- Pulp Logic uses 30.48mm; Intellijel 30mm
			- Holes diameter 3.175mm; centered 5.08mm from sides, 2.9972mm from top/bottom 
				- Following Pulp Logic's holes, farther from center than Intellijel
			- PCB clearance (for rails and neighbors)
				- Pulp Logic specifies a PCB maximum height of 28.702mm,
					width margin each side of 1.27mm (e.g. width 27.46 out of 30).
			- I might not be so precise about PCB size limits, but there isn't much room.
	- Signals
		- Audio
			- Line level? +/- 2.5v?
		- CV
			- 1v/Oct, 1 volt per octave
		- Gate
			- ?
	- Studio integration
		- InsertMe port can connect to Insert 3 on UMC-404HD, taking input from the
			microphone (low level, easily ignored) and sending output back to the
			studio in place of the microphone input (rarely used in my productions)
		- InsertMe port can connect instead to Insert 4 on UMC-404HD, to act as a
			guitar effects chain. Insert 4 is guitar, and the Skiff can use it as
			an input and return a processed version.
			- I believe the internal wiring of the UMC-404HD puts the front knob
				for each input between the input and the insert, so we can (for
				example) simply turn down the guitar input to switch from guitar
				effects mode to skiff-only mode. (For guitar-only, the skiff would
				need to pass the InsertMe input to its output cleanly. My design
				does not currently provide for that, so I expect to use the skiff
				primarily on Insert 4, replacing the microphone I rarely use, rather
				than as a guitar effects chain. I have VSTs for that, and the skiff
				isn't being designed with that in mind. It's simply a cool potential
				alternate mode that the InsertMe port allows for, to keep in mind.)
		- Headphone out can be used as a general-purpose stereo out (though "stereo"
			will likely be just the same signal in both ears).
		- MIDI IN allows external sequencers (etc.) to generate CV and gate outputs
			from "Module Zero", the top/bottom strip. In addition to the modular signals,
			we'll also generate an audio signal: the MIDI IN portion of Module Zero
			can be used as a mini-synth or MCO (MIDI-controlled oscillator). This is
			sort of cheating, but will be a valuable shortcut before I have more
			modules built. By starting with an MCO, I can immediately get in-tune
			waveforms to test the skiff's audio chain(s) with. Indeed, it will 
			immediately be a playable instrument, before any modules. At first there
			will be just one of each type of output (audio, CV, Gate), but it's probably 
			best to leave room on the front panel for several more. (Internally, they
			can be easily added later via a plug-in I2C/Stemma QT multi-DAC board.)
