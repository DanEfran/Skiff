A small, never-finished Modular Synthesizer, emphasizing little 1u modules.

A "skiff" is a small-ish, often portable, modular synth rack -- compared to
the huge racks many folks covet. They are sometimes built into equipment
cases or the like, so they have latching lids and handles. Or a skiff might
just be a small-ish case, made of wood or whatever else suits the builder.

This skiff is presently a case made of foam core, though I consider that
a rough draft and expect to upgrade it to wood eventually. It has a pretty
standard DIY power supply (+12v/-12v) and a power distribution board with
some little connectors (not the big Eurorack standard ones, little servo-
style connectors with just the essential power lines) for the first batch
of modules. On the top edge are a power jack, power switch, and some MIDI
and audio jacks that aren't wired up yet. The rest is open space waiting
for small modules, which I'll build one at a time when I'm bored and have
free time between other projects. I expect this will take years and will
never be really finished, but hopefully the first few modules will make it
musically useful in some capacity.

The next step will be the output buffer/amplifier and a preliminary sound
source (possibly an arduino-powered module to jump-start the skiff).
